 * And a tile rather than a dialog because a dialog could not survive being
 * used: enabling an application in the XDG Desktop tab starts it, a fresh window
 * asks to be raised, and an activation closes whatever overlay is up. So this

 * remotes dialog closing behind it), and the panels are still there after the
