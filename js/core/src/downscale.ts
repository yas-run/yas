 * Box-filtered minification for canvases the browser would otherwise shrink

 * A canvas whose backing store is bigger than its CSS box is resampled by the
 * compositor with one bilinear tap: four source pixels out of every N², which
 * past 2:1 throws most of the image away and reads as nearest-neighbour —
 * dropped scanlines in a video surface, disintegrating stems in a glyph.
 * Nothing in CSS fixes it. There is no mip chain behind a canvas, and every
 * `image-rendering` value still samples at most four texels.
 *
 * Halving in Canvas2D does fix it: at exactly 2:1 a bilinear tap *is* the 2×2
 * box average, so a chain of halves visits every source pixel. Reductions are
 * therefore quantised to powers of two, and the remainder — always under 2:1,
 * where one tap is the right filter — is left to CSS. Quantising also keeps
 * the picture stable while a pane is dragged: the chain only changes at
 * octave boundaries, not on every pixel of the drag.
