# yas CLI

yas is a terminal multiplexer and headless Wayland compositor. Terminals run CLI programs (PTYs) and GUI applications (compositor). Surfaces are video-encoded and streamed to browsers; the CLI gives programmatic control over both.

## Running standard processes

Use `yas run` for a pipe-oriented, non-PTY process. It connects stdin,
stdout, and stderr and exits with the process's status:

```bash
yas run --in /src/yas --env RUST_LOG=debug -- cargo test
```

`--in` selects the working directory on the server and `--env` is repeatable.
Options precede the program. The program is executed directly with no shell;
run a shell explicitly for pipes, redirects, globs, or other shell syntax.

## Running commands

```bash
ID=$(yas terminal start --cols 200 -- ls -la)     # run a command
ID=$(yas terminal start --cols 200)            # start a shell
```

Always use `--cols 200` or wider to avoid line wrapping. Tag terminals with `-t`.

The command is executed directly — no login shell, so no rc files and no shell
syntax. For a pipe, a redirection, a glob, or a `&&`, ask for the shell:

```bash
yas terminal start --cols 200 --shell 'make 2>&1 | tail -40'
```

Pass a working directory and environment variables the same way you would to
any other program. `--env` is repeatable, and options go _before_ the command:

```bash
yas terminal start --cols 200 --cwd /src/yas --env RUST_LOG=debug -- cargo run
```

`start` returns immediately. Use `--wait --timeout N` to block until completion:

```bash
yas terminal start --cols 200 --wait --timeout 120 make -j8
```

Or use `yas terminal wait` separately for pattern matching:

```bash
ID=$(yas terminal start --cols 200 make)
yas terminal wait "$ID" --timeout 120 --pattern 'BUILD (SUCCESS|FAILURE)'
```

## Sending input

```bash
yas terminal send "$ID" "ls -la\n" # type a command and press Enter
yas terminal send "$ID" "\x03"     # Ctrl+C
```

Supports C-style escapes: `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\0`, `\xHH`. Use `-` to read from stdin.

`\n` sends CR (0x0D), which is what a real terminal sends for Enter. This works
regardless of whether the program is in canonical or raw mode. `\r` also sends
CR. Use `\x0a` if you need a literal LF byte.

## Reading output

- `yas terminal show ID` — current viewport (what's on screen now)
- `yas terminal history ID --from-end 0 --limit N` — last N lines from scrollback
- `yas terminal history ID --since CURSOR` — only what is new since `SEQ`, `SEQ:COL`, `now`, or `start`

Always pass `--limit` or `--since`. Bare `history` is the whole scrollback.

`--since` prints a cursor to feed back in. `--json` is the structured form
(text plus the next cursor). Default cap is 256 KiB; the reply says where to
continue from if it truncated.

Both `show` and line-based `history` accept `--cols`/`--rows` to resize before
reading, and `--ansi` to preserve colors.

## Server event journal

The binary event journal is disabled by event type rather than globally. Its
default 1 MiB ring retains low-throughput lifecycle events; enable hot paths
only for targeted captures.

```bash
yas events config
yas events set --events 'default,+frame.*,+pty.*' --size 8388608
yas events set --if-revision 12 --events default --size 1048576
yas events dump                                # readable retained history
yas events tail                                # readable history, then follow
yas events tail --from-now                     # readable new events only
yas events dump --binary > snapshot.events     # one binary snapshot
yas events tail --binary -o live.events        # binary history, then follow
ID=$(yas events record start /var/log/yas.events) # detached server writer
yas events record list
yas events record stop "$ID"
```

`dump` and `tail` render readable records by default; `--binary` writes the
binary journal. `--output` names a local path. `record` paths are on the server and continue after the
starting client disconnects. A recording id is returned only after its header
and history are flushed; `record list` shows state, counters, and delayed write
errors. Event operations from extensions use the same access and stream budgets
as direct clients.

Trace native traffic across all families, including individual state records:

```bash
yas events set --events 'default,+frame.native.*,+datagram.native.*,+state.record.*'
yas events tail --from-now
```

`frame.native.*` includes session, trace, request and watch IDs, family/operation,
result status, State phase/revisions, ACK credit, and wire/payload byte counts.
`datagram.native.*` records reads, outbound queue acceptance, and queue drops.
`state.record.*` captures each State record, including nested Git query records.
`payload.native.*` additionally captures complete decoded request/event/result
bodies, including content marked sensitive. Binary bodies are split into bounded
chunks with trace IDs and offsets; human output previews long chunks.
Events-family traffic is excluded to keep following the journal from tracing
itself. Connection lifecycle and exit reasons are enabled by default.

For filesystem investigation, enable `git.*` and `fs.*`. These include watch
start/stop, queued update/record traces, and raw native notifications observed
before read-event filtering and coalescing. Raw notifications can occur without
a resulting State update. See `docs/events.md` for payload layouts and timing controls.

## Commands in a live shell

A shell that emits OSC 133 records each command (see
`docs/shell-integration.md`). Without that, the journal is empty.

```bash
yas terminal send "$ID" "cargo test\n"
yas terminal output "$ID" --wait 600          # that command's output; exits with its status
yas terminal journal "$ID"                    # INDEX STATUS EXIT MS START_SEQ END_SEQ COMMAND
yas terminal output "$ID" 3                   # command 3's output
yas terminal journal "$ID" --json
```

`--wait` blocks server-side until the command finishes (exit 124 on timeout).
`wait --pattern` matches only output produced after the wait began.

## Terminal lifecycle

```bash
yas terminal list            # show all terminals
yas client list              # show peers, subscriptions, and view sizes
yas client disconnect "$SESSION_ID" --reason "duplicate tab"
yas terminal close "$ID"     # tear down a terminal
yas terminal kill "$ID" TERM # signal the process, keep the terminal
yas terminal restart "$ID"   # re-run an exited terminal
yas terminal resize "$ID" 200 50  # set the viewport (cols rows)
yas terminal attach "$ID"    # drive it from here; Ctrl-] detaches
yas quit                     # shut down the server
```

Terminals persist until closed or the daemon exits. Clean up when done.

`attach` needs a real tty on stdin and repaints the remote grid in the
alternate screen, so your scrollback survives. It exits with the remote
program's status if that program finishes while you are attached.

`type` synthesises US-QWERTY keystrokes and understands `{Return}`;
`text` sends the characters themselves, which is the only way to reach
anything non-ASCII.

## Remotes

For a relay that must not have YAS control, create an X25519 identity once on
each endpoint, then exchange the public keys through a trusted channel:

```bash
export YAS_UPLINK_IDENTITY="$(yas uplink-keygen --private)"
yas uplink-public-key
```

Keep the private key in your secret configuration for later starts. With no
flag, `yas uplink-keygen` prints both `private_key` and `public_key` as JSON.
Run the producer with its own identity in the environment:

```bash
export YAS_UPLINK_TOKEN=CONTROL_TOKEN
yas uplink https://relay.example --allow-client CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY
```

`--allow-client` is repeatable; `YAS_UPLINK_CLIENT_KEYS` accepts comma-separated
public keys. Generate a connection URL on the producer using a consumer token
issued by the relay service:

```bash
export YAS_UPLINK_CLIENT_TOKEN=CLIENT_TOKEN
yas uplink-url https://relay.example
```

`--client-token TOKEN` overrides `YAS_UPLINK_CLIENT_TOKEN`. The command derives
the server public key locally and encodes the token; its URL never contains a
private key. Transfer it through a trusted channel. On the consumer, with its
own identity still in `YAS_UPLINK_IDENTITY`:

```bash
yas remote add sandbox 'UPLINK_URL_FROM_PRODUCER'
yas --on sandbox terminal list
```

Both keys encode 32 raw bytes in unpadded base64url; the private key is the
X25519 private key. Environment input keeps it out of process arguments. Explicit
`--identity PRIVATE_KEY` (producer) and `identity=PRIVATE_KEY` in the URI
(consumer) override the environment. The CLI passes its current environment
key to an existing proxy through local IPC; a home server uses its own
environment for Relay routes. Private keys never go to the relay.
Noise IK uses pinned X25519 identities, ephemeral X25519, and AES-256-GCM; legacy
bearer-only URIs and plaintext uplinks are rejected. Apply key changes by
restarting the uplink with the new identity/allowlist.

```bash
yas --on ssh:dev-server terminal list     # SSH (auto-installs yas)
yas --on share:mypassphrase terminal list # WebRTC share
yas --on prod terminal list               # named remote
yas --on local:work terminal list         # named local server (auto-starts)

yas remote add prod ssh:alice@prod.co
yas remote set-default prod
```

## Files

All paths are relative to `--root` (default: the client's cwd, resolved
against _your_ cwd, not the daemon's). `--json` emits NDJSON.

```bash
yas fs cat src/main.rs                  # print a file (bytes, unmodified)
yas fs find main.rs                     # fuzzy-find by path, best first
yas fs grep needle                      # search contents, PATH:LINE:TEXT
yas fs grep -e 'fn \w+' --root crates   # regex
yas fs grep -sw Config                  # case-sensitive, whole word
yas fs grep -l needle                   # matching paths only
yas fs grep --no-ignore TODO            # include gitignored files
yas fs sync . --json                    # mirror a tree, stream changes
```

`fs grep` is case-insensitive literal by default and honours `.gitignore`,
which is what keeps it fast on a tree with build output — `--no-ignore`
searches ignored files too and ranks them last. It exits 1 when nothing
matched, like grep(1), so `if yas fs grep -l TODO; then …` works.

Writes are compare-and-swap by default, so a concurrent change is a
conflict rather than a silent clobber (exit 1):

```bash
echo hi | yas fs write notes.txt              # unconditional overwrite
echo hi | yas fs write notes.txt --create     # fail if it exists
echo hi | yas fs write notes.txt --if-hash H  # only if unchanged
yas fs mkdir -p a/b        # create a directory
yas fs mv old new          # rename or move
yas fs rm -r dir           # remove a subtree
yas fs ln -s target link   # symlink (omit -s for a hard link)
```

## Git

Read-only introspection of repositories on the server. `--repo` picks the
worktree (default: cwd); `--json` emits NDJSON.

```bash
yas git status                     # branch, ahead/behind, stash, worktree
yas git status --watch             # stream changes
yas git log                        # history, newest first
yas git log v1.0                   # from a tag
yas git log main..feature          # a range
yas git log --follow -- src/main.rs
yas git diff                       # unstaged
yas git diff --staged              # staged
yas git diff main dev              # between two commits
yas git diff main...dev            # since they diverged (from the merge base)
yas git diff --merge-base main     # worktree vs where main forked (a `base` line names it)
yas git diff HEAD~2 -p -- src      # with hunks, limited to a path
yas git show HEAD:src/main.rs      # a file's bytes at a revision
yas git show HEAD                  # the commit object itself
yas git ls-tree HEAD                # one tree level (MODE TYPE OID<TAB>NAME)
yas git ls-tree HEAD:src            # descend by passing a path
yas git merge-base main feature     # best common ancestors (exit 1 if unrelated)
yas git ls-files                    # the index (MODE STAGE OID<TAB>PATH)
yas git ls-files src                # limited to a path prefix
yas git blame src/main.rs           # one row per attributed range
yas git blame src/main.rs --start 40 --lines 20   # just a viewport
yas git reflog                      # HEAD's reflog, newest first
yas git reflog refs/heads/main -n 5
yas git discover /workspace         # repositories under a path
yas git fetch origin                # per-ref outcomes; exit 1 if any refused
yas git fetch origin refs/pull/12/head --anchor
```

`blame` prints commit oids, not authors — resolve them with `git log` when
you need names, which keeps a viewport blame small. `fetch` runs the
server's own `git`, so its credential helpers and config apply, and it
exits non-zero when any ref was refused (plain `git fetch` can exit 0
having refused one refspec of several).

## Code intelligence

Language servers (rust-analyzer, gopls, clangd, …) are discovered by
project markers, spawned on the server, and stay warm across
invocations. Positions are 1-based PATH:LINE:COL; all commands take
`--root` (default: server cwd) and `--json` (NDJSON).

```bash
yas lsp wait                        # block until servers finish indexing
yas lsp diag                        # current diagnostics (exit 1 if any)
yas lsp diag --wait                 # settle first — use after editing files
yas lsp def src/main.rs:10:4        # definition of the symbol at 10:4
yas lsp refs src/main.rs:10:4       # references (--declaration to include it)
yas lsp hover src/main.rs:10:4      # type and docs
yas lsp complete src/main.rs:10:4   # completions (TSV: LABEL, KIND, DETAIL)
yas lsp signature src/main.rs:10:4  # signature, active parameter underlined
yas lsp symbols Config              # fuzzy workspace symbol search
yas lsp symbols --file src/main.rs  # file outline
yas lsp rename src/main.rs:10:4 nm  # rename plan (prints edits, never applies)
yas lsp list                        # running servers (ref, phase, memory)
```

A first call in a fresh workspace may exit 2 with "warming up" — run
`yas lsp wait` once, then query. The edit loop: change files, then
`yas lsp diag --wait` to see resulting errors.

## Key/value store

A prefix-watchable store on the server — the web app's settings live here,
and it doubles as host-local scratch space for scripts.

```bash
yas kv put build/status ok        # set from an argument
cat report.json | yas kv put ci/report   # or from stdin
yas kv get build/status           # value bytes to stdout (exit 1 if absent)
yas kv ls build/                  # keys under a prefix (TSV: KEY, SIZE)
yas kv ls build/ --values         # include values
yas kv ls build/ --watch          # stream changes as they happen
yas kv rm build/status            # delete
```

Writes are compare-and-swap when you ask: `--if-hash H` writes only if the
current value still hashes to H, exiting 1 on conflict. Without it a put is
an unconditional overwrite. `--durable` waits for disk.

## Extensions

```bash
yas ext run worker worker.wasm arg1 --guest-flag
yas ext run --persist --restart always worker worker.js arg1
yas ext manage
yas ext manage --from http://localhost:10003/ext
yas ext update --restart always worker worker.js
yas ext list
yas ext status NAME
yas ext attach NAME
yas ext commands --on prod
yas --on prod @builder --help
yas --on prod @builder build --release app
```

Everything after the module path belongs to the extension, hyphens included,
so `run`/`update` options go before the name. `--restart`, `--persist`,
`--detach` and `--json` written after the module are refused rather than
handed over; put a `--` first if the extension really wants one of them.

`yas ext manage` opens an inline extension picker. Move with arrows or `j`/`k`
and use Space or a mouse click to cycle the selected action: install for new
extensions, update then uninstall for outdated ones, or uninstall for other
installed extensions. Cycling again clears the action. `d` or Delete toggles
uninstall directly. Enter applies the marked actions; Esc cancels.
`a` selects all available installs and updates (press again to clear), and `u`
selects only updates. Neither bulk shortcut selects uninstalls. Uninstalling
disables the extension, waits for it to stop, then removes its persistent
definition; installed extensions absent from the registry can also be removed. The
default registry is `https://yas.run/ext`; `--from` selects another
HTTPS registry or a loopback HTTP development registry. Updates preserve the
definition's arguments, flags, restart policy, and runtime limits.

Objects beginning with the WebAssembly magic bytes run in Wasmi. Other
objects must be UTF-8 ECMAScript modules and run directly in QuickJS. A
QuickJS module may export a default function; its integer return value is the
extension exit code. The global `yas` object provides the initialized
`context`, complete-packet `send`/`recv`, `wait`/`waitUntil`, clocks, random
bytes, sleep, and logging. `recv()` blocks and returns `undefined` only when the
endpoint closes. `wait()` returns 1 for a packet and 2 for closure;
`waitUntil()` also returns 0 when its deadline is reached.

`yas ext commands` lists live command namespaces advertised by named,
persistent extensions. Connection options must precede `@name`; every later
token is sent to the extension verbatim, including `--json`, `--on`, and other
tokens beginning with `-`. A final `--help` immediately after an advertised
command path is rendered locally from its descriptor. Redirected stdin is
streamed to the command, while terminal stdin starts closed.

## Web panes

In the browser UI, `Ctrl+B w` opens a URL the server can reach as a
tiling pane. The empty-pane entry doubles as a location bar: `[remote>][command]`
takes a URL wherever it takes a command, so `localhost:3000` or
`prod>localhost:3000` opens a pane instead of a terminal (a scheme or a port is
what marks it as a location; a bare word stays a command). Locations are
remembered per server in its KV store, and the focused pane takes over the
status bar with back/forward/reload and its title.

## Port forwarding

Forward local ports to whatever the server can reach — `ssh -L` over any yas
transport, plus UDP. Specs are `[kind/][bind:]port:host:hostport`, where kind
is `tcp` (default) or `udp`.

```bash
yas forward 8080:localhost:3000               # local 8080 → server's :3000
yas forward 8080:localhost:3000 5432:db:5432   # a list, one connection
yas forward udp/5353:resolver.internal:53      # a UDP flow per local source
yas forward tls/8443:api.internal:443          # server terminates TLS
yas forward 0:db.internal:5432                 # port 0: pick one, print it
yas --on prod forward 5432:db.internal:5432    # through a named remote
```

Listeners bind to **127.0.0.1** unless a bind address is given: the local
socket has no passphrase in front of it, so binding a wildcard address would
hand the relay to anyone who can reach the machine. Every spec binds before
any starts serving, so a failed bind leaves nothing running.

Forwards end with the process — the listening socket is local, so there is
nothing to reattach to. Keep a set of them in `~/.config/yas/yas.forwards`:

```bash
yas forward add web 8080:localhost:3000   # add or update an entry
yas forward list                           # every entry, disabled ones marked
yas forward toggle web                     # disable without removing
yas forward rm web
yas forward --all                          # start every enabled entry
```

A `tls/` forward takes plaintext locally and speaks TLS to the target, so
`curl http://localhost:8443/` reaches an `https://` service without a
certificate anywhere on your side. `--alpn h2,http/1.1` offers ALPN (omitted
offers none, which is not the same as offering http/1.1) and the negotiated
protocol is printed once. `--insecure` skips certificate verification, and the
server must permit it too (`yas server --allow-forward-insecure`) — a client
asking is not enough. Plain `tcp/` forwards stay opaque: TLS the local client
speaks passes straight through, end to end.

By default the relay reaches whatever the server reaches. To restrict it, give
`yas server --allow-forward 'host[:ports]'` (a name, a `*.suffix` glob, an
address, a CIDR block, or `*`; repeatable, or `YAS_ALLOW_FORWARD`) — one
pattern makes it an allowlist, loopback still permitted. `YAS_NET=0` turns
forwarding off entirely.

UDP note: yas's wire is reliable and ordered, so relayed datagrams get
retransmission and head-of-line blocking they did not ask for. Fine for
DNS-shaped request/response traffic; poor for anything running its own
congestion control, such as QUIC.

## SOCKS5 proxy

Proxy TCP into the server's network with a single local port — `ssh -D`. The
target comes from each request instead of a spec, so nothing has to be known in
advance. The listen address is `[bind_address:]port`.

```bash
yas socks 1080                                  # SOCKS5 on 127.0.0.1:1080
yas socks 0.0.0.0:1080                          # reachable from the network
yas socks 0                                     # pick a port, print it
yas --on prod socks 1080                        # through a named remote
curl -x socks5h://localhost:1080 http://api.internal/
```

Use a client that sends **names**, not addresses: `socks5h://` in curl,
`network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` in Firefox, `--proxy-server="socks5://…"` in
Chrome. Names are resolved on the server, so the proxy reaches hosts this
machine cannot look up — which is most of the reason to use it over a forward.
A client that resolves locally still works but loses that.

CONNECT only: BIND and UDP ASSOCIATE are answered `0x07` (command not
supported). No authentication beyond the no-auth method. Failures keep their
reason — a name that does not resolve is `0x04`, a refused connection is
`0x05`, a target denied by `--allow-forward` is `0x02` — so a client reports
what actually happened.

Binds **127.0.0.1** unless a bind address is given, and the default matters
more here than for a forward: a forward hands out one target, a proxy hands out
everything the server can reach. The same `yas server --allow-forward` patterns
and `YAS_NET=0` govern it. The proxy ends with the process.

## Clipboard

```bash
yas clipboard list                            # list available MIME types
yas clipboard get                             # read clipboard (text/plain)
yas clipboard get --mime image/png > shot.png # read specific MIME type
yas clipboard set "hello"                     # set clipboard from argument
echo "hello" | yas clipboard set              # set clipboard from stdin
yas clipboard set --mime image/png < shot.png # set specific MIME type
```

## GUI surfaces

On Linux, GUI apps launched in a terminal connect to the built-in Wayland compositor automatically.

```bash
ID=$(yas terminal start firefox)
ID=$(yas terminal start brave --ozone-platform=wayland https://example.com)
```

Chromium-based browsers and Electron apps need `--ozone-platform=wayland`.

### Surface commands

```bash
yas surface list                                   # list surfaces (TSV: ID, TITLE, SIZE, APP_ID)
yas surface close 1                                # close a surface (sends xdg_toplevel close)
yas surface capture 1                              # screenshot → surface-1.png
yas surface capture 1 --output s.png --scale 240   # 2x render (scale in 120ths: 120=1x, 240=2x)
yas surface click 1 100 50                         # left-click at (100, 50)
yas surface click 1 100 50 --button right          # right-click
yas surface click 1 100 50 --button middle         # middle-click (pastes the primary selection)
yas surface click 1 100 50 --button back           # thumb buttons: back, forward
yas surface key 1 Return                           # key press
yas surface key 1 ctrl+shift+c                     # modifier combo
yas surface type 1 "hello{Return}"                 # type text ({braces} for special keys)
yas surface text 1 "café — naïve"                  # commit literal UTF-8 (non-ASCII works)
yas surface scroll 1 3                             # scroll down 3 wheel notches
yas surface scroll 1 -2 --horizontal               # scroll left 2 notches
