//!
//! # What happens to the processes a command leaves behind
//!
//! These are the server's rules (`crates/server/src/process.rs`), on Unix:
//!
//! - Every spawned child is the leader of a **new process group**
//!   (`setpgid(0, 0)`); it has no controlling terminal and inherits no file
//!   descriptor above 2.
//! - When the direct child exits, the server sends `SIGTERM` to its whole
//!   process group at once. Group members still holding the stdout/stderr
//!   pipes (`cmd &` in a shell script) keep the Transfers open; once every
//!   pipe closes, or after the kill grace (2 s by default,
//!   `YAS_PROCESS_KILL_GRACE`), whichever is first, the server sends
//!   `SIGKILL` to the group. So **background jobs do not outlive the command**
//!   unless they leave the process group (`setsid`, `setpgid`, a daemonizing
//!   double fork into a new session). Those escape and are never tracked.
//! - When the session that spawned an **ordinary** process closes (the
//!   [`Client`] is dropped, the connection breaks, the server shuts down),
//!   the group gets `SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after the grace; the exit record
//!   says [`ExitReason::OwnerLost`].
//! - A **detachable** process ([`Command::detachable`]) survives its session:
//!   other sessions find it with [`Client::processes`] and [`Client::attach`]
//!   to it (output produced while nobody was attached is lost, not replayed).
//!   Its final exit record is kept for at most 5 minutes after it exits.
//! - A server restart ends every tracked process; an unclean server death
//!   can leave processes running unless the deployment adds cgroups or a
//!   parent-death signal.
//!
//! On Windows the child runs in a kill-on-close job object that contains its
//! whole tree, in a process group of its own. When the direct child exits,
//! the job is terminated once its pipes close or after the kill grace (a
//! [`Command::leave_residue`] process's job is left running instead).
//! `Terminate` sends `CTRL_BREAK` to the group and terminates the job after
//! the kill grace; a group no console event can reach (no console, or one it
//! left) has its job terminated at once. `Kill` terminates the job. Of the
//! [`Signal`]s, `Kill` terminates the job and the others send `CTRL_BREAK`,
//! the only console event that reaches one process group. Children get a
//! hidden console of their own when the server has none, so no window opens
//! for them on a desktop.
//!
//! Operation IDs deduplicate `SPAWN` and `CONTROL` **within one session**: if
//! a call times out locally, resending the same [`Command`] (same
//! [`Command::operation_id`]) on the same [`Client`] returns the original
//! process instead of starting a second one. A new session does not see the
//! old session's operation IDs (and its ordinary processes are gone anyway).
//!
//! # Capacity
//!
//! A server admits a bounded number of live processes per session (16 by
//! default), in total (64), and in flight (8 spawns), plus pending
//! [`Client::wait_process`] calls (32) and attach/control operations (16).
//! Beyond those a call fails with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. Operators raise them
//! with `yas server --process-max-per-session N` and its siblings (see
//! `docs/design/processes.md`). [`Client::process_limits`] reports what this
//! session's server enforces, including values above the original maxima.
//! [`host::HostOptions::arg`](crate::host::HostOptions::arg) passes the same
//! flags to a hosted server.
//!
//! Every stdout/stderr stream holds its [`Command::window`] of the
//! session's receive budget ([`crate::HelloOptions::receive_budget`], 16 MiB
//! unless the client asks for more) while it is open. Unless a command sets
//! one, [`Client::default_process_window`] sizes it so that the server's
//! per-session maximum of processes fits: 384 KiB at the default of 16 in
//! 16 MiB (or 256 in 256 MiB), never more than 1 MiB nor less than 16 KiB.
//! Over a network a stream carries at most about a window a round trip.
