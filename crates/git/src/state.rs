//! The `GIT_STATE` engine (docs/design/git.md): one thread per watched
//! repository owning the mutable-state stream. Engines are shared across
//! opens — a crate-level registry keyed by canonical gitdir attaches every
//! `start_state` of one repo to the same engine, so N opens cost one
//! thread, one repository handle, and one set of watchers. The engine cuts
//! each status selection once with its own budgets, sharing HEAD and stat
//! caches, and runs at the minimum requested settle window; per-open state
//! (requested flags, ack window, identical-snapshot suppression) lives on
//! each subscriber, whose snapshot uses its selected status segment. Every
//! snapshot is complete — the client obligation is "replace the map" —
//! and pacing is coalescing per subscriber: at most one snapshot in
//! flight, the latest state wins once acked.
