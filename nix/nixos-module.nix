          on <literal>SCHED_OTHER</literal> at priority 0 and competes with
          the compositor and the video encoders it shares a machine with.
          It then misses its cycle deadline exactly when there is most to
          do — scrolling a window, resizing, anything that saturates a core
          — and the gap is cut into the captured audio itself, before any
          of it is encoded or sent. No client-side jitter buffer can
          recover audio that was never captured.

          RTKit rather than a raised <literal>rtprio</literal> limit on the

          to the process that asks, and polices what it hands out — and
          being a system service it also covers a server run by hand
          outside systemd, which an rlimit on the unit would not.
