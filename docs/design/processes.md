# RFC: Native non-PTY processes

- **Status:** Implemented as native YAS Process family v1, including `yas run`
- **Date:** 2026-08-05

## Summary

The native YAS Process family starts non-PTY child processes, writes
stdin, receiving binary stdout and stderr, listing server-visible children,
watching their streams, and controlling their complete lifecycle. The protocol
is available to every logical session. A network client and an in-process
extension use the same selected family and framing.

Every successfully started child receives a public, server-boot-scoped
`process_handle`. Any process-capable session can list children and concurrently
attach to one. There is deliberately no
cross-client capability or confidentiality boundary inside this family.

Ordinary processes remain owned by their creating endpoint and are terminated
when it disappears. An opt-in detachable process instead survives with zero or
more watchers and remains discoverable by `process_handle`. Both forms are
flow-controlled and independent of Wasmi, extensions, or native channels.

## Goals

- Preserve arbitrary stdin, stdout, stderr, argument, and environment bytes
  where the host platform permits them.
- Give every client the same native family API and lifecycle behavior.
- Give every process-capable client server-global discovery, observation, and
  control of native children.
- Let an explicitly detachable process survive a client reconnect or extension
  attempt restart without replaying unbounded output.
- Bound process counts, watches, queued stream payload, Transfer messages,
  arguments, environment data, and catalog replies.
- Make endpoint close reliably terminate and reap ordinary owned children.
- Support Unix process groups and Windows jobs without hiding platform-specific
  signaling behavior.

## Non-goals

- **No implicit shell.** The server executes `argv[0]` directly.
- **No terminal emulation.** Programs needing a controlling terminal continue
  to use Terminal `CREATE` with an explicit launch specification.
- **No server-restart persistence.** The catalog and its references never
  survive a restart. Orderly shutdown terminates tracked children; an unclean
  server death can leave OS processes behind unless the deployment supplies
  cgroups, jobs, parent-death signaling, or equivalent containment.
- **No output replay.** Output produced before a watch begins, or while no
  endpoint watches a process, is drained and discarded. Lifetime offsets expose
  the exact gap but do not recover its bytes.
- **No per-client process privacy or control boundary.** Discovery, streams,
  the stdin-writer role, and lifecycle controls are available to every endpoint
  allowed to use the family. The single-writer rule coordinates byte offsets;
  it is not authorization.
- **No privilege boundary.** Children run as the YAS server OS identity.
- `yas run` provides attached spawn and standard-stream forwarding; catalogue,
  detached execution, watching, and control also remain available through the
  native library surface.
- **No dependency on extensions.** Extension support is one consumer, not an
  implementation prerequisite.

## Native YAS contract

Process is family `0x0040`, version 1. The canonical Requests, Events, records,
limits, and Transfer descriptors are generated from
[`protocol/yas/families/process.toml`](../../protocol/yas/families/process.toml);
the family contract is in [yas.md](yas.md#process-family).

`SPAWN` carries a nonzero operation ID, exact argv/environment byte strings, an
explicit cwd source, stream policy, and initial stdout/stderr credit. It executes
`argv[0]` directly without an implicit shell. A successful Result returns a
boot-scoped `process_handle`, current lifetime offsets, and sensitive BYTE
Transfer descriptors for stdin, stdout, and (unless merged) stderr. The operation
ID prevents a lost Result from spawning a second child.

`WATCH` subscribes to the public process catalogue. Complete ProcessRecord state
contains lifecycle, generation, owner session, detachable flag, argv0, native
PID for diagnostics, stream offsets, exit data, and retention deadline. `ATTACH`
returns fresh output Transfers starting at current lifetime offsets; earlier
output is an explicit gap and is not replayed. Any number of sessions may
observe output, while at most one attachment owns stdin.

`CONTROL` provides typed signal, terminate, kill, and detach actions under
nonzero operation IDs. `WAIT` returns the final portable exit record or
`TIMEOUT`. A client that sets `SPAWN_REPORT_EXIT`, where the server offers it
(family-limit tag 19), is sent that record as an `EXIT` event once the exit is
final, so a command's exit costs no round trip of its own: SPAWN's Result, its
output and its exit all travel from one request. yas-client sets it whenever
offered, and `Process::wait` then takes no request and no pending-`WAIT` slot
unless the attachment that reports the exit went first (a stream reset or
dropped before its end, a detach), when it sends `WAIT`, as it does against
older servers. With it, `SPAWN_KEEP_OUTPUT` sends only a head and a tail of
each output stream, as the SPAWN asks: the server drops the middle as it reads
it, so a command writing far more than its client keeps runs at the speed of
its pipe, and the `EXIT` event says what was dropped, counted as a UTF-8
decoder would count it (bytes, lines, code points, UTF-16 units).
yas-client's `Command::keep_output` asks for it where offered, and
`Process::elided` reads the counts. Closing stdin half-closes the
child stream. An ordinary child belongs
to its spawning session and is terminated when it disappears; a detachable
child remains discoverable until its retained final record expires. The spawning
session can still WAIT for an ordinary child that has gone when its exit did not
reach it: its attachment went first (a stream reset or dropped, a DETACH, a
route failed as the exit came), or the exit found its queue full. The server
keeps such exits for that session alone, as many as the process generations
maximum (64 by default, never fewer), until the session ends.

Arguments and environment values preserve arbitrary bytes on Unix and use exact
UTF-8-to-native conversion on Windows. The cwd union is server default, native
path bytes, a Terminal handle, or an FS root plus component-vector path. Public
process handles are identity, not authorization; every session with the selected
family shares the same process authority.

## Capacity and backpressure

Process family limits are selected in HELLO. By default a server enforces
1,024 arguments, 1 MiB of argument bytes, 256 environment entries, 1 MiB of
environment bytes, 16 processes per session, 64 process generations
server-wide, 8 pending spawns, 8 MiB of buffered stream data, and five minutes
of detached-result retention. Each session also admits at most 16
completion-held `ATTACH`/`CONTROL` operations and 32 pending `WAIT`s.

Server policy may lower them. For workloads such as an agent running many
commands at once on one session, it may raise them up to the extended hard
maxima:

| Maximum                        | Flag                           | Environment                      | Default | At most |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Live processes per session     | `--process-max-per-session`    | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_PER_SESSION`    | 16      | 16384   |
| Process generations            | `--process-max`                | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX`                | 64      | 65536   |
| Spawns in flight per session   | `--process-max-pending-spawns` | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_PENDING_SPAWNS` | 8       | 4096    |
| Stream buffer (stdin window)   | `--process-stream-buffer-max`  | `YAS_PROCESS_STREAM_BUFFER_MAX`  | 8 MiB   | 1 GiB   |
| Environment entries per SPAWN  | `--process-max-env`            | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_ENV`            | 256     | 16384   |
| Pending `WAIT`s per session    | `--process-max-waits`          | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_WAITS`          | 32      | 65536   |
| `ATTACH`/`CONTROL` per session | `--process-max-operations`     | `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_OPERATIONS`     | 16      | 16384   |

Flags override the environment. `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_PER_CLIENT` is the older name
of `YAS_PROCESS_MAX_PER_SESSION`. A malformed or out-of-range variable is
ignored with a warning. A malformed or out-of-range flag stops the server. The
server advertises exactly what it enforces: values above the v1 hard maxima
travel in optional extended limit tags, and clients from before them see the v1
maxima ([yas.md § Process family](yas.md#process-family)).

The per-session capacities that bound processes grow with the configuration:

- the session's outbound Transfers: 32, plus two for every process per session above 16;
- operation replays: 256, or two per process plus the pending spawns and operations if that is more;
- retained exit replies: the server-wide process maximum.

So do the server-wide budgets:

- reserved stream windows (`YAS_PROCESS_BUFFER_MAX`): at least 3 MiB per generation;
- retained spawn-request bytes: 64 KiB for every process above the defaults.

`YAS_PROCESS_MAX_SPAWNING` (concurrent native spawn calls server-wide) defaults
to the pending-spawn maximum.

A session's streams share its receive budgets, each side's HELLO
`receive_max_buffered` (16 MiB unless a client declares more, up to 1 GiB):

- **stdout and stderr**: every open stream holds the receive credit its client
  granted, whether or not it writes, and that credit comes out of the client's
  declared buffer: once it is all held, a new stream gets none until another
  lets go. A client that runs many processes on one session should use smaller
  windows, or declare a wider buffer. yas-client divides three quarters of its
  budget (`HelloOptions::receive_budget`) between the stdout and stderr of the
  server's per-session maximum: 24 KiB each at 256 processes in 16 MiB, 384 KiB
  in 256 MiB. Over a network a stream carries about a window a round trip.
  The server sends output as far as the credit reaches, so a window smaller than
  one 64 KiB chunk still makes progress (servers that predate configurable
  maxima waited for credit through a whole chunk).
- **stdin**: pipes take their windows from the server's receive budget. They
  never take its last quarter, which stays free for requests, credit and PING
  results. Each gets at most an equal share of the rest at the configured
  processes per session, and at least 4 KiB.
- A spawn whose stdin window cannot be granted at all fails with
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. `SPAWN_STDIN_NULL` needs no window.

Cancellation may settle the wire request, but it does not recycle admission
while committed or uncancellable backend work is still running. One generation
can arm only one terminate-escalation timer. Ordinary exit replies remain
retryable in a bounded per-session FIFO (64 records by default); older terminal
records are evicted deterministically rather than growing with process churn.

Admission reserves the process generation, session/global count, and required
Transfer receive budgets before invoking the OS. Failure settles with
`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
and creates nothing. Transfer credit provides byte backpressure independently
for stdin, stdout, and stderr; MESSAGE/frame counts are bounded by the common
Transfer limits. A slow attachment cannot force unbounded process-wide output
retention.

The spawning session's credit paces the child itself: the server reads a pipe no
more than 1 MiB (32 frames) ahead of what that session's Transfer has taken, so a
command that writes faster than its owner reads blocks on its pipe and loses
nothing. Other sessions' attachments are not waited for. One that falls 1 MiB
behind is dropped alone: its Transfers are reset with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, and a
`WAIT` it had pending still answers at the exit. Its session and its other
processes go on. (Servers up to 0.4.0 dropped the owner too when it fell behind,
and closed the lagging session's whole Process endpoint with it.)

The pacing outlasts the child. Once it has exited and nothing of its group is left,
what its pipes still hold reaches the owner however slowly the owner takes it: the
kill grace, and a `LEAVE_RESIDUE` grace, bound only the time the group's residue
keeps the streams open. The server stops waiting for the owner when no reader has
waited for it for 250 ms (a process outside the group holds a pipe open with nothing
coming) or when a stream has given 1 MiB more (such a process writes on). An owner
that stops reading keeps its process's slot until it reads, drops the streams, or
its session ends, as a local pipe's reader would.

Catalogue State is coalesced under its subscription credit. Output offsets are
lifetime counters, so a later `ATTACH` reports the exact skipped prefix rather
than pretending to replay bytes that were not retained. A detachable final
record retains only bounded metadata until its deadline; terminal attachments do
not extend that deadline.

Kernel pipe buffers, child memory, descendant count, and address space are
outside protocol accounting. Deployments requiring hard containment must wrap
the server in jobs, cgroups, rlimits, or an equivalent OS policy.

## Cleanup and shutdown

Each session owns its pending spawns, ordinary children, Transfer endpoints, and
attachments; the server owns the public process catalogue. Session cleanup
stops admission, cancels queued spawns, closes Transfers, and releases stdin
ownership. Ordinary children are terminated as a group or job and force-killed
after the configured grace. Detachable children lose only that session's
attachments.

Spawn tasks are registered before they can create an OS child. If a spawn
finishes after its session disappears, a detachable child enters the catalogue
without an attachment; an ordinary child is immediately terminated and reaped.
Every path releases its reserved counts and credits.

On Unix, ownership is registered before the process can race the server's
reaper, and exact wait status is consumed once. On Windows, kill-on-close job
ownership contains the process tree. Server shutdown first refuses new work,
then runs the same session cleanup, terminates detachable generations, and
discards retained finals.

## Security and deployment

`SPAWN` is remote command execution as the YAS server OS user, at authority
parity with Terminal `CREATE` using an exact launch specification. It is not a
sandbox. Every session allowed to select Process may list process records,
observe future output, claim vacant stdin, and send lifecycle controls. Process
handles are stable identity within one server boot, not capabilities.

Catalogue records omit environment values and arguments after argv0 to reduce
accidental disclosure, not to create a confidentiality boundary. Children may
inherit server credentials. Mutually untrusted tenants require separate servers
or external containment.

`YAS_PROCESS=0` or `--no-processes` leaves Process unavailable during HELLO. A
session cannot send family Requests which were not selected. Selected versions,
required limits, reserved fields, common status, and sensitive framing are
validated before spawn admission. Relay, edge, proxy, and transports forward
native frames without translating Process semantics. A changed server `boot_id`
invalidates every cached process handle.

## Implementation status

The native migration is complete across:

1. `protocol/yas/families/process.toml` and generated Rust/TypeScript constants,
   with schema validation, packed-record validators, and golden vectors.
2. `crates/server/src/process.rs`, which owns native semantic process records,
   spawn admission, concurrent pipe I/O, Transfer endpoints, catalogue State,
   lifecycle, reaping, groups/jobs, detachable retention, and cleanup.
3. `crates/server` native Process dispatch and `js/core/src/yas/process.ts`,
   without a retired-wire compatibility dispatcher.
4. `yas run`, which forwards stdin/stdout/stderr and propagates the portable exit
   result over the same native Process family available to extensions.

Tests cover binary streams, credit, duplicate operation IDs, cancellation,
cross-session catalogue state, concurrent attachments, stdin ownership and EOF,
merged stderr, spawn failures, inherited environments, descriptor hygiene,
bounded overflow, shutdown, Unix groups, and Windows jobs. Platform-specific
signal and containment tests remain part of CI.
