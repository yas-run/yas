# Services

## yas.run

`crates/website` is the only public service for `yas.run`. One Rust process
serves:

- the embedded `js/web` build at `/` and `/s`;
- `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, and `SKILL.md`;
- `/channel/<pubkey>/<producer|consumer>` WebSocket signaling;
- `/ice`, `/message`, and `/health`.

Requests to `/` receive the landing page only when `Accept` includes `text/html`.
All others receive the PowerShell installer for PowerShell user agents, or the
shell installer otherwise. The scripts download stable-name assets directly
from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/yas-run/yas/releases/latest).
`/ext/<asset>` proxies assets from the same release with CORS headers so
browsers can use `https://yas.run/ext` as an extension registry.

Signaling messages are Ed25519-verified. Redis stores expiring presence and
relays messages between instances. `yas share` and the `/s` browser client use
`wss://yas.run` as their default signaling endpoint.

## Fly.io

Production uses the `yas-887` Fly organization:

- app: `yas-run`;
- region: `cdg` only;
- two shared-CPU Machines with 256 MB each;
- auto-stop disabled;
- one pay-as-you-go managed Redis primary in `cdg`, with no read replicas;
- custom apex domain: `yas.run`.

See [`crates/website/README.md`](crates/website/README.md) for first deployment.
`./bin/deploy-website` deploys from the repository root. Pushes to `main` that
touch the website, browser bundle, installers, or deployment config run
`.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` using `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

## CI and releases

CI runs on standard GitHub-hosted Linux, ARM Linux, macOS, and Windows
runners. It parses every Nix file, checks formatting and Clippy, runs Rust,
JavaScript, end-to-end, and coverage tests, builds all release platforms, and
runs a bounded campaign over every YAS wire fuzz target.
The native Windows build and macOS test build reject Rust compiler warnings,
including platform-specific unused code. WebTransport bandwidth and loss tests
use QUIC over an in-memory link with a virtual clock; real UDP tests cover
connection lifecycle and forwarding without measuring host throughput.

Coverage summaries appear in the Actions job summary for every run, with the
HTML report uploaded as an artifact. Same-repository PRs also receive a coverage
comment; fork PRs use the job summary because their token cannot post comments.

Signed tags run the same gates with longer fuzz campaigns, then build Linux and
macOS tarballs plus a Windows zip. The release job uploads both versioned
filenames and stable aliases such as:

```text
yas_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
yas_linux-musl_x86_64.tar.gz
yas_darwin_aarch64.tar.gz
yas_windows_x86_64.zip
```

GitHub release assets are the only binary publication origin; the website
redirects stable download paths there. Archives contain the YAS license and
the Apache-2.0 license for the vendored `yas-alacritty-terminal` engine.
There is no Debian package, APT repository, GPG release-signing path, or
GitHub Pages release site.

The release also publishes workspace crates, JavaScript packages, binary npm
packages, extensions, and the Homebrew update. `./bin/publish-crates` validates
and publishes the fixed-version vendored terminal crate before
`yas-terminal-driver`, waiting for each dependency layer to be indexed.

## Local service installation

Running yas under systemd, launchd, or the Nix modules is documented at
[docs.yas.run/operating/system-services](https://docs.yas.run/operating/system-services) and
[docs.yas.run/operating/nix](https://docs.yas.run/operating/nix). The checked-in user units live
in [`systemd/`](systemd/).

## Uplink services

A service running `yas uplink https://relay.example` needs
`YAS_UPLINK_TOKEN` for control-plane routing, `YAS_UPLINK_IDENTITY` containing
its X25519 private key as 43-character unpadded base64url, and `YAS_UPLINK_CLIENT_KEYS` containing
the comma-separated public keys allowed to reach its YAS socket. Create the
identity once with `yas uplink-keygen --private`. Supply the private key through
the service environment to keep it out of process arguments. With that key in
`YAS_UPLINK_IDENTITY`, `yas uplink-public-key` prints its public key, and
`yas uplink-url https://relay.example` generates a connection URL using
`YAS_UPLINK_CLIENT_TOKEN`. Keep the same identity across service restarts.
Private keys do not belong on the relay.

Consumers independently pin the producer's public key and use their own
private identities. Keys and the producer allowlist are loaded at startup;
restart the uplink service to apply rotation or revocation. Upgrading from
bearer-only uplinks requires configuring both endpoints and updating consumer
URIs. Relays must forward opaque TLS records and encrypted datagrams. See
[uplink setup](https://docs.yas.run/remote/uplink) and the [uplink protocol](docs/design/uplink.md).
