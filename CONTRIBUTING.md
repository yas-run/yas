## Getting started

### Install Nix and direnv

The project uses Nix for all tooling — the Rust toolchain, wasm-pack, pnpm, Node, cargo-watch, and everything else. There is no `Makefile` that installs things piecemeal and no list of system dependencies to chase down. One `flake.nix` pins every tool to an exact revision, so every contributor builds with identical versions regardless of OS or distro. If it works in the dev shell, it works in CI.

direnv makes this invisible. Instead of remembering to run `nix develop` every time you `cd` into the repo, direnv evaluates `.envrc`, enters the Nix dev shell, and adds `bin/` to your PATH automatically. Leave the directory and it restores your previous environment. The result: you open a terminal, `cd yas`, and every tool is just there.

**1. Install the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

This is preferred over the official Nix installer because it enables flakes and the nix command out of the box, configures uninstall support, and works reliably on both macOS and Linux without manual `nix.conf` edits.

**2. [Install direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html)** and [hook it into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).

**3. Allow the `.envrc`:**

```bash
cd yas
direnv allow
```

The first run downloads and builds the toolchain (cached after that). Once you see `yas dev shell`, you're ready.

### Without direnv

If you'd rather not install direnv, you can enter the dev shell manually:

```bash
nix develop -c $SHELL
```

You'll need to re-run this every time you open a new terminal in the repo.

## Quick start

Once you're in the dev shell, build and persist the muster extension, then
install the repository's worktree source:

```bash
./bin/extensions
yas ext run --persist --restart always muster extensions/dist/muster.wasm
./bin/install-in-muster
yas @muster list
```

The extension and worktree registration are one-time setup. Muster watches Git
and the checked-in `.yas/muster` definitions, adding or removing one stack as
worktrees appear or disappear. See
[Dev environment](#dev-environment) for details.

## Building and testing

```bash
nix build .#yas                  # complete product build
./bin/tests                      # complete Rust, extension, and JS tests
./bin/clippy                     # clippy (CI fails on any warning)
./bin/fmt --check                # formatting check (CI fails on any diff)
./bin/fmt                        # auto-fix formatting
./bin/lint --check               # fmt check + clippy (CI gate)
./bin/lint                       # auto-fix formatting + clippy
./bin/build-shaders              # rebuild compositor SPIR-V, including color variants
./bin/build-shaders --check      # check source/binary consistency without writing
```

`./bin/fmt` runs `cargo fmt` (Rust) and `prettier` (JS/TS/JSON/MD). `./bin/lint` runs fmt + clippy together; pass `--check` to check instead of auto-fixing.
The repository wrappers materialize the generated UI and `js/web` assets that
Rust embeds at compile time; raw workspace-wide Cargo commands require those
assets to have been built first.

TypeScript (JS workspace — core, react, solid, UI, and web):

```bash
cd js && pnpm install && pnpm test
```

The full test runner also builds `yas-uplink`'s `uplink-interop` example and
runs the browser WebCrypto tests against that native endpoint. For a focused
run, build it with `cargo build -p yas-uplink --example uplink-interop`, then
run the core tests. `YAS_UPLINK_INTEROP_BIN` overrides its executable path.

Or individual packages:

```bash
cd js && pnpm --filter @yas-run/core run test
cd js && pnpm --filter @yas-run/react run test
```

E2E (Playwright, requires built binaries):

```bash
./bin/e2e
```

The browser harness uses Bash, a fixed test passphrase, and an isolated
WebSocket edge. It disables inherited embedded-edge, WebRTC-share, and
WebTransport settings. Keep the Playwright version in `e2e/package.json`
aligned with the pinned Nix `playwright-test` package and browser bundle.

Uplink E2E (included in `./bin/tests` on Unix):

```bash
direnv exec . cargo test -p yas-cli --test uplink_e2e
```

This starts an isolated YAS server, an HTTPS control endpoint, a WSS/WebTransport
relay, and the producer and consumer CLIs. It checks remote execution, stdout,
stderr, exit status, encrypted relay traffic, and rejection of unauthorized
clients, incorrect server pins, and invalid routing tokens. It uses a temporary
CA and does not require a deployed relay or modify system certificate trust.

Browser uplink E2E:

```bash
./bin/e2e --config playwright.uplink.config.ts
```

The regular `./bin/e2e` suite includes this spec. It drives Chromium through
Edge and a home server's Relay connection to an uplink remote, opens that
remote's terminal, and verifies browser input executes there. The isolated
fixture uses the same encrypted relay as the CLI E2E. This covers the supported
browser-through-Edge flow, not a direct browser uplink transport.

For local runs using an already built UI and CLI, build the fixture with
`direnv exec . cargo build -p yas-cli --example uplink-e2e-fixture`, then run
`direnv exec . e2e/node_modules/.bin/playwright test --config e2e/playwright.uplink.config.ts`.

CI (`ci.yml`) runs `./bin/lint`, `./bin/tests`, `./bin/e2e`, `./bin/coverage`, and `./bin/package-crates`. These delegate to `nix run .#<task>`, etc.

## Packaging

Every `nix run` target has a corresponding script in `bin/`:

```bash
./bin/build-tarballs         # release tarballs -> dist/tarballs/
./bin/publish-npm-packages   # npm publish @yas-run/browser, @yas-run/core, @yas-run/react, @yas-run/solid
./bin/publish-crates         # cargo publish
./bin/package-crates         # build every crates.io crate from its package, as its users will
```

`publish-crates` publishes with `--no-verify`, so nothing there notices a crate
that only builds inside the repository; `package-crates` (a CI job) does. A
crate's build must not reach outside its own directory: `yas-wire` builds from
its checked-in `src/generated.rs` when `protocol/` is not there, and `yas-edge`
embeds the web UI from `js/ui/dist`, or from the copy in `crates/edge/ui/` that
both scripts put into its package.

`build-tarballs` accepts an optional output directory argument (default `dist/tarballs`).
The version and platform are derived from `flake.nix` and the build host.
Linkage is verified at `nix build` time — on Linux the musl binary must have only `libc.so` as a NEEDED library, the glibc binary targets glibc 2.31 via `cargo-zigbuild` (all other deps statically linked), and macOS binaries must not reference nix-store dylibs.

Individual packages can also be built directly:

```bash
nix build .#yas
```

There is no `rustfmt.toml` or `.clippy.toml` — default rustfmt, prettier, and `clippy -D warnings` are the style enforcement. `./bin/fmt` runs both formatters in one pass.

## Dev environment

`./bin/install-in-muster` writes one source for the repository into the
selected server instance's muster configuration directory. The source derives
an instance for the main checkout and every linked worktree containing
`.yas/muster`. Pass `--force` to replace an older installer-owned entry and
`--on TARGET` when yas's effective target is not that server. The installer
checks the running extension before writing. A oneshot first authorizes each
worktree's distinct `.envrc`. Each command then points direnv at its own
`${STACK_DIR}`; direnv enters that checkout's environment and resolves its
`bin/dev-*` entrypoint without deriving the worktree root from the stack's
path. Muster supervises these units in each instance:

| Unit         | What it does                                                             | Default port / socket                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `direnv`     | Authorizes the worktree's `.envrc` before other units start              | n/a                                   |
| `build`      | Builds the profiling `yas-cli` replacement                               | n/a                                   |
| `js`         | Builds browser WASM, installs JS deps, then watches `crates/browser/src` | n/a                                   |
| `server`     | Runs the profiling `yas server`, serving the browser itself              | `local:<instance>`, `127.0.0.1:10001` |
| `ui`         | Vite dev server for `js/ui/`                                             | `127.0.0.1:10000`                     |
| `website`    | Vite dev server for `js/web/`                                            | `127.0.0.1:10002`                     |
| `extensions` | Builds `extensions/dist`, then serves it as a CORS extension registry    | `127.0.0.1:10003`                     |

HMR is disabled in both Vite dev servers. Reload the page manually to apply
source changes.

Inspect and control the stack through muster:

```bash
yas @muster status <instance>/server
yas @muster restart <instance>/js
yas @muster log -u <instance>/server -f
```

### Running multiple dev stacks

The main worktree always receives the four-port block beginning at `10000`.
Muster allocates a durable block to each linked worktree, so adding or removing
another worktree never moves an existing stack. Socket and state paths include
the derived instance name.

Each instance is a standard named local server. Address the main checkout
directly as `local:yas`, or save it under a shorter target name:

```bash
yas remote add dev local:yas
yas --on dev terminal list
```

`YAS_DEV_EDGE_HOST` selects the development edge's bind address and
`YAS_PASSPHRASE` replaces the development-only `dev` fallback.

| Instance | UI    | Edge  | Website | Extensions |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| main     | 10000 | 10001 | 10002   | 10003      |
| second   | 10004 | 10005 | 10006   | 10007      |
| third    | 10008 | 10009 | 10010   | 10011      |

The UI dev server proxies `/ext` to its own instance's registry, so the
Extensions tab of a remote offers the modules _this_ stack built rather than
the published ones. It goes through the page's origin rather than straight to
`127.0.0.1:10003` so that it also works when the dev UI is reached through a
tunnel or reverse proxy, where there is no port to derive from and the registry
port is not published.

Use `yas @muster stacks`, `list`, `status`, and `doctor` to inspect allocated
instances, unit state, and configuration errors. See
[`extensions/muster/README.md`](extensions/muster/README.md) for the complete
command and configuration reference.

## Project structure

Most Rust crates are one or two source files. The CLI crate (`yas-cli`) is split into several files and `yas-webrtc-forwarder` uses a multi-file module tree.

| File                                       | Role                                                                                                              |

## Code conventions

**Flat crate layout.** Don't introduce deep `mod` trees. If a crate grows, add files at the same level (like the `cli/src/yas_*.rs` family clients) and `mod` them from the root. `yas-webrtc-forwarder` is the one exception with a multi-file module tree.

**Wire protocol changes** touch multiple layers. A new operation requires:

1. A stable family/kind/layout entry under `protocol/yas/`, including limits and sensitivity metadata.
2. Regenerated checked-in artifacts via `cargo xtask protocol`, with no manual edits to generated files.
3. Typed Rust and TypeScript payload codecs plus the server and client family handlers.
4. Shared golden vectors, truncation/limit tests, lifecycle integration tests, and the relevant fuzz registry entry.
5. Updates to [the YAS RFC](docs/design/yas.md) and any affected family companion.

**Tests live next to the code.** Rust family and server tests sit beside their implementations or under each crate's `tests/` directory. TypeScript tests live under each package's `src/__tests__/` directory. Cross-language payload vectors are generated under `protocol/yas/` and consumed by both implementations.

**Release profile** uses `opt-level = 3`, LTO, `codegen-units = 1`, and `panic = "abort"`. On Linux, two release tarballs are produced: a glibc variant (all deps statically linked, glibc 2.31+ via zig cc, dlopen works for GPU) and a musl variant (all deps statically linked except musl libc) for Alpine. Both are single-binary tarballs. Nix verifies linkage at build time.

## Versioning and releases

All release-versioned workspace crates (everything except the fixed-version
`xtask` tool), every versioned member of the `js/` pnpm workspace, the
`extensions/` workspace, and `nix/common.nix` share a single version number.
`bin/prepare-release` discovers all four sets rather than listing them, so a
new crate or pnpm workspace member is versioned without editing the script.
The JS packages live in a pnpm workspace rooted at `js/` with a shared
`js/pnpm-lock.yaml`; `js/web` declares no version and is left alone.

The `extensions/` cargo workspace is excluded from the root one because its
members only build for wasm32, but it is not independently versioned: its
version is what `extensions/dist/manifest.json` publishes, and the objects a
`#digest` pin outlives are release assets under `releases/download/v<version>/`.

The path-only terminal engine under `vendor/yas-alacritty-terminal/` has its
own fixed fork version. `./bin/publish-crates` validates that exact local path
and version, publishes it as the first dependency layer when needed, and waits
for the registry index before publishing `yas-terminal-driver`.

Releases go through a three-step process:

1. **Prepare**: `./bin/release-prepare 0.12.0` runs `bin/prepare-release` locally (version bumping, validation, tests), pushes a `release/<version>` branch, and opens a PR against `main`.
2. **Tag**: After the PR is merged, run `./bin/release-tag 0.12.0` to create a signed tag and push it to origin.
3. The `release.yml` workflow triggers on the `v*` tag push. It first verifies the tag signature via the GitHub API — unsigned or unverified tags fail the workflow immediately.

`git tag -s` honors Git's configured signing format. This project uses SSH
signing (`gpg.format=ssh`), so release tags do not require GPG; the removed APT
repository was the only GPG-specific release path.

CI on the verified tag builds tarballs and Windows archives,
publishes the GitHub release plus crates.io and npm packages, and updates the
Homebrew tap.

## Guardrails

- `./bin/lint --check` is the CI gate (fmt + clippy). Run `./bin/lint` to auto-fix formatting and `./bin/clippy` to check clippy warnings before pushing.
- The WASM crate (`crates/browser/`) targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — don't add dependencies that pull in `std::net`, `std::fs`, etc.
- `crates/browser/pkg/` is gitignored. It must be built locally (`./bin/build-browser`) before the UI or React tests will work.
- The server uses raw `libc` calls (`openpty`, `waitpid`, `kill`, `ioctl`) — changes to PTY lifecycle code need careful attention to signal safety and fd leaks.
- The background zombie reaper (`waitpid(-1, ..., WNOHANG)` every 5s in the server) can race with `cleanup_pty`'s `waitpid` for the specific child. This is intentional — `cleanup_pty` uses `WNOHANG` so it doesn't block if the reaper already collected the child.

## Wayland compositor (experimental)

The experimental headless Wayland compositor (`crates/compositor/`) is `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` only — it compiles to a stub on macOS and Windows. It uses `wayland-server` directly and runs as a single shared thread across all terminals.

### How it works

1. When the first PTY is created, `ensure_compositor()` spawns a compositor thread with a calloop event loop.
2. The compositor creates a Wayland listening socket (`/tmp/wayland-N`) and sets `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` in the PTY child environment.
3. GUI apps launched inside any terminal connect to this socket and create `xdg_toplevel` windows.
4. On each `wl_surface.commit`, the compositor uploads the buffer as a persistent GPU texture (SHM is uploaded, DMA-BUF is imported via Vulkan), composites the surface tree, and sends a `CompositorEvent::SurfaceCommit` with the composited `PixelData` to the server.
5. The server encodes the pixel data as H.264 or AV1 (zero-copy from a VA surface when available, or from BGRA staging) and stores the encoded frame in `last_frames`. The tick loop sends frames to connected browser clients using the same pacing/congestion-control system as terminal updates.
6. Browser clients decode frames via WebCodecs and render to a `<canvas>`.

### Key data flow

```
Wayland app → compositor thread → CompositorEvent::SurfaceCommit
  → server tick: SurfaceEncoder::encode() → last_frames
  → server tick: pacing check → msg_surface_frame → edge WS → browser
  → browser: SurfaceStore → VideoDecoder → canvas
```

### Surface encoding

`crates/server/src/surface_encoder.rs` wraps seven backends behind a common `SurfaceEncoder` interface:

- **NVENC AV1 / H.264** — NVIDIA GPU hardware encoding via CUDA + NVENC SDK (dlopen, no FFmpeg)
- **AV1 VA-API** — Intel/AMD GPU hardware encoding via libva directly (dlopen, no FFmpeg)
- **H.264 VA-API** — Intel/AMD GPU hardware encoding via libva directly (dlopen, no FFmpeg)
- **AV1 (rav1e)** — software, handles odd dimensions. Capped at 3840x2160: rav1e has no limit of its own, but past 4K it stops keeping up.
- **H.264 software (openh264 and/or x264)** — software fallback, max 3840x2160. Both are cargo features of `yas-server` (and `yas-cli`); default is `openh264` (MIT-friendly), release `-gpl` artifacts use `x264` (GPL-2.0-or-later, better compression). Build with neither and the software fallback is AV1-only.

Hardware AV1 (NVENC, VA-API) goes to 8192x4352; everything else stops at 3840x2160. The ceiling is applied per viewer rather than per surface — `surface_encode_cap()` in `crates/server/src/lib.rs` resolves it from the backend that won the chain, and `mediated_size_for_surface()` translates each ceiling into compositor pixels at that viewer's requested scale before taking the widest across a surface's subscribers. This lets a sub-1× viewer drive a larger 1× source while `per_client_encode_target()` still downsamples into the viewer's smaller encoded frame. A viewer's ceiling is also intersected with the decode size negotiated by the native Surface client; clients that report nothing are held at 3840x2160 encoded pixels.

`--surface-encoders` / `YAS_SURFACE_ENCODERS` is a comma-separated priority list. The server tries each in order and uses the first that succeeds. Default: `av1-nvenc,h264-nvenc,av1-vaapi,h264-vaapi,av1-vulkan,h264-vulkan,h264-software,av1-software` — NVENC and VA-API are tried before the compositor-resident Vulkan Video tier, which remains ahead of software. Vulkan Video uses the same per-client target size, surface pacing gate, adaptive quantizer, and one-frame delivery discipline as the other encoders; only speed control is unavailable. A refused 4:4:4 profile retries the same Vulkan codec at 4:2:0 before a 4:2:0 refusal advances to the encoders below it (see `docs/server.md` for how that is decided, and for the two ways 4:4:4 can come back no). `YAS_SURFACE_BANDWIDTH` (low/medium/high/ultra, or a raw AV1 quantizer 10-255) is the ceiling on the bit budget — adaptation is always on and only moves cheaper than what you set, and `YAS_SURFACE_SPEED` (slow/medium/fast/realtime, or a raw 10-255) controls how much encoder time a frame may cost. `YAS_VAAPI_DEVICE` selects the VA-API render node (default `/dev/dri/renderD128`). `YAS_CUDA_DEVICE` selects the CUDA device ordinal for NVENC (default `0`). Inbound media has the mirror-image knobs: `--camera-codecs` / `--microphone-codecs` (or `YAS_MEDIA_CAMERA_CODECS` / `YAS_MEDIA_MICROPHONE_CODECS`) narrow what viewers may send, and viewers pick within that from the media panel.

### Testing surfaces without a browser

```bash
yas --on local:yas terminal start bash
yas --on local:yas terminal send 1 'foot &\n'
yas --on local:yas surface list             # list surfaces (TSV)
yas --on local:yas surface capture 1        # screenshot → surface-1.png
yas --on local:yas surface click 1 100 50   # click at (x, y)
yas --on local:yas surface key 1 Return     # press a key
yas --on local:yas surface type 1 'hello'   # type text
```

### Native Surface delivery

Surface catalogue records arrive through the Surface family's State snapshot and deltas. Each independent view then receives typed frame or frame-chunk Events, with keyframes, codec changes, and ACK pacing governed by its negotiated limits. Clipboard content uses the Selection family and mixed audio uses Media; neither is multiplexed through a global opcode space.
